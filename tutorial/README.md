A short tutorial how to build your own VCL distribution,
how to design a webpage with VCL and how to build a component demo.

## How to build a VCL distribution
[Based on](http://blog.alex-rudenko.com/2014/08/18/getting-started-with-a-new-css-framework-called-visual-component-library-vcl/)

0.  You will need a current version of NodeJS and NPM installed
    because all VCL modules are published as NPM modules.
    
    If you haven't done it yet, download the tutorial folder from github.
    
1. As you can see the folder contains several files and a folder:
  * index.styl is the main script that defines how other VCL modules are processed.
  * index.html is an example website, you can use later.
  * package.json is a description of the VCL distro containing references to all needed VCL modules.
  * vcl-override.styl is a file where one can override default VCL styles.
  * vcl-theme-terms.styl is a file where one can define some variables which may used later on in the styles. For instance, colors.
  * vcl-var-override.styl is a file where variables exposed by the VCL modules can be defined.
    
2.  Open a terminal and execute "npm install" from the tutorial folder.
    After that a node_modules folder will appear which will contain all VCL modules specified in the package.json.
    
3.  From the tutorial folder run the VCL preporcessor to build your VCL distro:
    ```
    node ./node_modules/vcl-preprocessor/bin/vcl.js index.styl compiled.css
    ```
    You should see "âœ” Succesfully compiled input to compiled.css" in the terminal if everything is fine.
    
## Designing a page with VCL

At this point, you should already have a functional page. If you open the index.html, while the file compiled.css
is in the same directory, you should see an example blog-page.

Explanation of index.html:
First, we include our compiled version of VCL using:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="compiled.css">
```
Using the CSS class vclGridRow we define a new row of our layout. Class vclVAlignMiddle specifies the vertical alignment in the middle
Using the CSS class vclGridSpan-3 we define that the element will take 3/15 of the page width.
This kind of classes is typical for fluid-grid CSS frameworks. The total width of the page is 15 as defined by VCL.
We define a horizontal menu on the top of the page using the vclHorizontalNav class:
```
<nav id="nav" class="vclHorizontalNav vclHorizontalNavLight" role="navigation">
```

We define a tree (sidebar) navigation using the vclTreeNav class:
```
<nav id="nav" class="vclTreeNav vclTreeNavLight" role="navigation">
```

To define search box we use the vclInputGroup component:
```
<div class="vclInputGroup">
    <input autocomplete="off" type="text">
    <span class="vclInputGroupButton"><button class="vclButtonStd vclSquare"><span><i class="fa fa-search"></i></span></button></span></div>
</div>
```
    
Now we've learned how to get started with VCL. Read more about properties and configuration options of each one of the VCL modules on [GitHub](https://github.com/vcl/vcl).


## How to build a component demo
[Based on](http://blog.alex-rudenko.com/2014/09/21/learning-vcl-how-to-build-a-vcl-component-demo/)

You might want to know what a component might look like. There for you can build a component demo.
In this tutorial we will build a demo for vcl-gallery. It should already be installed,
if you did the previous tutorial. If not, run:
```
npm install git://github.com/vcl/gallery.git

0.  Switch to the directory of the component, you want to build. For this exampe switch to either
    ../tutorial/node_modules/vcl-include-all-modules/node_modules/vcl-gallery/
    or
    ../tutorial/node_modules/vcl-gallery
    
1.  Now build the subpackages needed for building a demo. Since these are devDependencies they are not automatically build in subfolders.
    To build the demo, run from vcl-gallery:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    
2.  After installing the requiered packages, run from vcl-gallery:
    ```
    npm test
    ```
    If it was successful, you should now have a folder build in vcl-gallery.
    You can now access the demo on [localhost](http://localhost:8000/example.html).
